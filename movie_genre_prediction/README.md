# Movie Genre Prediction
First I tried the prediction based on the TF-IDF example given in the course. <br />
The result were not that good. Maximum Accuracy was 0.54 (movie_pred_with_sklearn) <br /> <br />

Second Model was a pretrained BERT from huggingface. <br />
Which gaves much better results (movie_pred_bert)
